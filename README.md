In this project I will look at several academic papers that overlook the topics of explainability and interpretability then I will do my own personal sentiment analysis on them, next I will do a sentiment analysis using the [Flair natural language processing (NLP) tool](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair){:target="_blank"}. Finally I will compare and contrast my results with that of Flair and will compile that with my findings into a single paper, which I will publish here.  

The goal of this project is to analyze and contextualize the way that the topics of explainability and intepretability are discussed in academic papers and amongst those with the greatest understanding.
