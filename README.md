In this project I will look at several academic papers that overlook the topics of explainability and interpretability then I will do my own personal sentiment analysis on them, next I will do a sentiment analysis using the Flair natural language processing (NLP) tool. Finally I will compare and contrast my results with that of Flair and will compile that with my findings into a single paper, which I will publish here.
